As a Texas-born company, we specialize in crafting federally compliant delta-9 THC edibles under the 2018 Farm Bill. Our products, including gummies, chocolates, tinctures, and beverages, are infused with hemp-derived delta-9 THC at or below 0.3% by dry weight, ensuring they meet all legal standards while delivering a mild, uplifting experience.
